## 🌠 Vision Statement

What’s the dream here? Describe the ambitious idea and how it could change user experience, architecture, performance, or innovation in the project.

> Example: “Imagine a container orchestration layer that natively integrates semantic chunking and dynamic RAG pipelines—adaptively scaling based on concept drift in live streams.”

---

## 🔍 Current Limitations

Outline what's holding your team or project back today. Are there inefficiencies, missing integrations, scalability barriers, or UX gaps?

---

## 🚀 Proposed Epic Scope

Break down the major components of the idea—this isn’t just an enhancement; it’s a roadmap.

- New services / modules
- Refactored architecture
- Docker image changes or orchestration logic
- Persistent environment configurations
- Event-driven triggers or autoscaling enhancements
- Integration points with AI tooling or external APIs
